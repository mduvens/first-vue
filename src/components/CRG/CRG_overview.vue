    <p><strong>L9019: Computação e Representação Gráfica</strong></p>
    <p> The main objective is to give the students a generic knowledge in the field of computer graphics.
      Introduce the students to the graphic concepts and systems as used in the film, game and webindustry.</p>
    <p>The students will study the origins of computer graphics and get a knowledge on the evolution of
      the field to the state of the art. The students will learn about the pinhole camera model, which is the
      basis for most graphics systems. The student will study the application of geometrical
      transformations fort 2D and 3D graphic systems using homogeneous coordinates. Furthermore the
      students will study rasterization and the use of color-models</p>
    <h2 id="course-mechanics">Course Mechanics</h2>
    <p>The class will meet on Fridays from 14:40 to 16:10 in room <del>N1</del>E10.
      There is also a lab session on Tuesday in room <del>N1</del>E10 from 14:00 to 14:50.</p>
    <p>The material for the course originates from various books on the topic and the course is taught with
      a complete set of handouts. Students are rates based on presence, two written tests and lab
      assignments. Practical work is mostly based on threejs based applications. The use of the threejs
      library allows the students to write small javascript based web applications, without the burden of
      having to implement all the mathematics behind the system</p>
    <h2>Prof. Kooima's Notes</h2>
    <p>We will also use Prof. Kooima's excellent notes, which he has kindly allowed us to copy <a
